# Basic-Security-Configurations-Lab-1-2-3-
These are basic security configuration labs on cisco routers
- In the first two labs, I configured enable password and enable secret for all routers
- Then, I configured encryption for the enable plaintext password
- In the last lab, I used a console cable connection to congiure R1 via the PC
- Then, confiured line console 0 password when trying to enter line console mode
